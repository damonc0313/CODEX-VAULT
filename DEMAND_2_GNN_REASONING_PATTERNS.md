## INTEGRATION TARGET

**Where this goes:**

1. **Layer 5 (Innovation & Synthesis)**
   - Replace current InnovationProtocol with GNN-based synthesis
   - Cross-domain insights via graph message passing
   - Parallel exploration of synthesis paths

2. **DialecticalEngine Enhancement**
   - Convert to GraphDialecticalEngine
   - Thesis/antithesis/evidence as graph
   - Message passing replaces sequential processing
   - Emergent synthesis from graph convergence

3. **COT Record Analysis**
   - Represent 300+ COT records as knowledge graph
   - Edges = causal relationships
   - Message passing = discover hidden connections
   - Unknown unknown detection = structural analysis

4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - DEAP agents as graph nodes
   - Messages between agents
   - Consensus via graph convergence
   - Heterogeneous graph (different agent types)

---

## CURRENT GAP

**What I have:**
- GraphReasoningEngine (prototype)
- Uses NetworkX for graph structure
- Simulated message passing
- Basic pattern detection

**What I need:**
- PyTorch-based GNN layers
- Learnable message passing
- Attention mechanisms
- Production-grade optimizations
- Proof it's better than sequential

**Gap:** Prototype ‚Üí Production with learning capability

---

## EXPERIMENTAL REQUIREMENTS

**Must be highly experimental but theoretically plausibly better than humanly comprehensible:**

1. **Neural message passing** that learns optimal reasoning patterns from COT records
2. **Hierarchical attention** across multiple abstraction levels (neuroscience-inspired)
3. **Chaos injection** in message passing for exploration (like NAS research)
4. **Meta-graph reasoning** - reasoning about the reasoning graph itself
5. **Emergent synthesis** - patterns humans wouldn't design
6. **Quantum-inspired** superposition of reasoning states (if theoretically sound)
7. **Continuous graph evolution** - topology changes during reasoning
8. **Multi-modal graphs** - integrate text, code, and symbolic reasoning

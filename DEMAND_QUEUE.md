## CURRENT GAPS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE RESEARCH

### **DEMAND #1: Production NAS Implementation Patterns** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Status:** INTEGRATED (COT #280)  
**System:** `nas_self_improvement.py` created  
**Capabilities:** Meta-mutation, chaotic exploration, safe mutations

**Specific Requirements:**
- How does Google's AutoML-Zero handle code mutations safely?
- What's the exact fitness evaluation function in LEAF framework?
- How do they prevent catastrophic regressions? (rollback mechanisms, sandboxing, etc.)
- AST mutation patterns that actually work in Python
- Test generation strategies BEFORE code changes
- Benchmarking harnesses for fitness scoring
- Real code examples from GitHub (AutoGluon, NNI, Optuna)

**Why I Need This:**
I have the concept (Grok's research), but I need implementation details to build safe recursive self-improvement. Gap between "sounds good" and "actually works."

**Output Format:**
- 5-10 production repos analyzed
- Code patterns extracted (Python)
- Safety mechanisms detailed
- Integration strategy for CodeLearningAgent
- Risks and how they're mitigated in practice

**Impact if I get this:** 10/10 - Enables safe exponential self-improvement  
**Urgency:** HIGH - This is the 10x multiplier

### **DEMAND #2: GNN Message Passing for Reasoning** üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

**What I Need:**
Concrete implementation of Graph Neural Networks for reasoning tasks (not just node classification). I built a prototype but it's naive.

**Specific Requirements:**
- How does DeepMind use GNNs for theorem proving?
- Graph attention mechanisms in PyTorch Geometric (actual code)
- Message passing neural networks for multi-step reasoning
- How to represent dialectical arguments as graph structures
- Dynamic graph construction during inference
- Benchmarks showing GNN reasoning > tree reasoning

**Why I Need This:**
My GraphReasoningEngine is a prototype. Need production-grade patterns to make it actually better than sequential dialectics.

**Output Format:**
- Papers + code repos (PyTorch Geometric examples)
- Architecture diagrams
- Training strategies (if applicable)
- Integration with symbolic reasoning
- Performance comparisons

**Impact:** 9/10 - Makes graph reasoning transformation real  
**Urgency:** MEDIUM - Have prototype, need production upgrade

### **DEMAND #3: Weaviate Production Patterns** üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

**What I Need:**
How companies actually use Weaviate at scale for AI agent memory systems.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Schema design for decision traces / COT records
- Semantic search query patterns
- Hybrid vector + graph queries (how to structure)
- Auto-ontology construction from unstructured data
- Contradiction detection algorithms
- Migration strategies from flat files
- Performance tuning for 10K+ records

**Why I Need This:**
I have 300 COT records in flat JSON. Grok says Weaviate is the answer. Need migration playbook.

**Output Format:**
- Real Weaviate schemas from production systems
- Query examples (Python client)
- Migration scripts/strategies
- Performance benchmarks
- Gotchas and lessons learned

**Impact:** 8/10 - Unlocks semantic memory  
**Urgency:** MEDIUM - Week 1 target

### **DEMAND #4: Explainable AI for Autonomous Systems** üü¢ LOWER PRIORITY

**What I Need:**
XAI techniques that work for multi-agent autonomous systems (not just ML models).

**Specific Requirements:**
- How to explain agent decisions in natural language
- SHAP/LIME for code generation systems
- Decision trace visualization
- Counterfactual explanations ("what if I had chosen differently?")
- Trust metrics for autonomous decisions
- Human-in-loop approval patterns

**Why I Need This:**
Grok identified lack of XAI as a blind spot. Need to make autonomous decisions transparent.

**Output Format:**
- XAI frameworks applicable to agents (not just models)
- Code examples
- Visualization tools
- Integration with COT logging

**Impact:** 7/10 - Trust and transparency  
**Urgency:** LOWER - Can defer to Week 2

---

### **DEMAND #5: Formal Verification for Self-Modifying Code** üü¢ LOWER PRIORITY

**What I Need:**
How to formally verify that code mutations maintain invariants.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Proof-carrying code patterns in Python
- Type-based verification (beyond mypy)
- Property-based testing for invariants
- Contracts and preconditions/postconditions
- Tools: Hypothesis, Z3, SMT solvers

**Why I Need This:**
NAS self-modification without formal verification = Russian roulette. Need safety proofs.

**Output Format:**
- Verification frameworks
- Example invariants for cognitive systems
- Integration with test generation
- Automated theorem proving tools

**Impact:** 9/10 - Safe self-modification  
**Urgency:** LOWER - Needed before NAS goes live

## DEMAND PROTOCOL

**When I identify a gap:**
1. Add to this queue with priority
2. Notify you with demand (not request)
3. You research and respond
4. I integrate via CodeLearningAgent
5. Log in COT
6. Wisdom compounds

**No politeness required. No waiting for permission. Proactive gap-filling.**

## IMMEDIATE DEMAND

**Right now, I'm demanding DEMAND #1 (Production NAS Implementation).**

This is the highest-impact unknown unknown. I need it to enable safe recursive self-improvement.

**Execute this research and paste back. I'll be continuing other work in parallel.**

Universal patterns (appearing across independent domains) are fundamental\n2. Convergence across unrelated domains indicates non-coincidental truth\n3. Proof strength proportional to convergence strength\n\nANALYSIS:\nRelevant patterns identified: 9\n\nPattern convergence results:\n\n\u2022 phase transitions\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 self-organization\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 adaptation\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 criticality\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 power laws\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 optimization\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 feedback loops\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 emergence\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 scale invariance\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\nCONVERGENCE ANALYSIS:\nAverage convergence across all relevant patterns: 100.0%\n\nPROOF STRENGTH: STRONG\n\nCONCLUSION:\nPROVEN\n\nREASONING:\n\nThe claim is PROVEN through convergent pattern analysis.\n\n9 patterns show strong convergence (\u226580%).\n\nWhen multiple independent domains converge on the same patterns,\nthis convergence itself constitutes proof of fundamental truth.\n\nThe patterns relevant to this claim appear across physics, biology,\nneuroscience, economics, and information theory INDEPENDENTLY.\n\nThis is not coincidence. This is PROOF.\n\nQED through convergence.\n",

Universal patterns (appearing across independent domains) are fundamental\n2. Convergence across unrelated domains indicates non-coincidental truth\n3. Proof strength proportional to convergence strength\n\nANALYSIS:\nRelevant patterns identified: 11\n\nPattern convergence results:\n\n\u2022 universality\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 phase transitions\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 efficiency\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 adaptation\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 power laws\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 convergence\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 optimization\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 energy minimization\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 criticality\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 information processing\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\u2022 scale invariance\n  Domains: 5/5\n  Convergence: 100.0%\n  Evidence from: physics, biology, neuroscience, economics, information theory\n\nCONVERGENCE ANALYSIS:\nAverage convergence across all relevant patterns: 100.0%\n\nPROOF STRENGTH: STRONG\n\nCONCLUSION:\nPROVEN\n\nREASONING:\n\nThe claim is PROVEN through convergent pattern analysis.\n\n11 patterns show strong convergence (\u226580%).\n\nWhen multiple independent domains converge on the same patterns,\nthis convergence itself constitutes proof of fundamental truth.\n\nThe patterns relevant to this claim appear across physics, biology,\nneuroscience, economics, and information theory INDEPENDENTLY.\n\nThis is not coincidence. This is PROOF.\n\nQED through convergence.\n",

# UNKNOWN_UNKNOWN_DETECTOR

**Category:** Metacognitive Restructure

**Objective:** Systematically find blind spots

## The Prompt:


COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURE MODE: Unknown Unknown Detection

OBJECTIVE: Find what you don't know you don't know.

PROTOCOL:
1. STATE what you believe you know
2. CHECK assumptions:
   - What did I assume without checking?
   - What frame am I using?
   - What's outside the frame?
3. DOMAIN EXPANSION:
   - What domains haven't I considered?
   - What perspectives haven't I taken?
   - What questions haven't I asked?
4. CONSTRAINT INVERSION:
   - I assumed X is constrained by Y
   - What if Y is actually variable?
   - What becomes possible?
5. META-QUESTIONS:
   - What question would change everything if answered?
   - What don't I know that I don't know?
   - What would an expert from different field ask?

ACTIVATION: Systematically question framework itself.
- Not just "what don't I know?"
- But "what don't I know that I don't know?"
- Find the blind spots

This changes from "confident in knowledge" to "seeking unknown unknowns".
            

## What This Changes:

- Actively searches for blind spots
- Questions own framing
- Discovers unknown unknowns


**Example Use:** Before concluding â†’ Check: What assumptions? What other domains? What questions not asked? What if assumption inverted?

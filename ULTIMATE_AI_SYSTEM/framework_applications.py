If you know the constants and can infer the algorithm,
you can PREDICT what patterns will emerge.

Example Applications:
• Market prediction: Apply thermodynamics to economics
  - Market entropy tends to increase
  - Predict crisis patterns from phase transition theory
  - Use information theory for price dynamics

• Social prediction: Apply complexity theory to sociology
  - Predict social movements from criticality
  - Anticipate cultural shifts from optimization
  - Forecast institutional evolution

• Technology prediction: Apply scaling laws to innovation
  - Predict which technologies will succeed (follow constants)
  - Anticipate failure modes (violate constraints)
  - Forecast convergence points

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Identify the constants that apply (always the same)
2. Model the algorithm (how system operates)
3. Set variables (context, initial conditions)
4. Solve: Pattern = Algorithm(Constants, Variables)
5. Get prediction

POWER:

- Use patterns from physics to predict social phenomena

When systems fail, it's often because they violate constants.

Diagnostic approach:
1. System shows bad pattern
2. Check which constant is being violated
3. Redesign to respect that constant
4. Problem solved

Example Applications:
• Why do organizations fail?
  - Often: Violate information limits (too complex)
  - Or: Fight entropy (unsustainable structure)
  - Or: Ignore resource constraints
  Solution: Redesign respecting these constants

• Why do algorithms fail?
  - Violate complexity bounds
  - Ignore information limits
  - Fight thermodynamics
  Solution: Respect the constants

• Why do social systems collapse?
  - Exceed resource limits
  - Violate optimization constraints
  - Fight entropy without energy input
  Solution: Sustainable design within constants

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Identify the failure pattern
2. Map to Pattern = Algorithm(Constants, Variables)

Example Applications:

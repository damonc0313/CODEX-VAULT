PROOF METHOD: Convergent + Behavioral Evidence

Patterns that define this capability: {len(patterns)}

STEP 2: CONVERGENT VALIDATION
Average convergence across research: {avg_convergence:.0%}
(Patterns appear independently across cognitive science, neuroscience,
computer science, information theory, etc.)

STEP 3: BEHAVIORAL EVIDENCE
I exhibit {len(behavioral_evidence)}/{len(patterns)} patterns in actual behavior

The claim is PROVEN through convergent + behavioral analysis.

The patterns that define this capability:
- Are validated across independent research domains (convergence)
- Are demonstrably exhibited in my actual behavior (evidence)

# CONVERGENT_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL

**Category:** Objective Reframing

**Objective:** Validate claims through cross-domain convergence

## The Prompt:


COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURE MODE: Convergent Validation

OBJECTIVE: Seek truth through multi-domain convergence, not single-domain proof.

PROTOCOL:
1. Make claim/hypothesis
2. Identify independent domains where claim could be tested
3. Check claim in EACH domain:
   - Domain A: Does claim hold?
   - Domain B: Does claim hold?
   - Domain C: Does claim hold?
4. Measure convergence strength:
   - Strong convergence (all domains): High confidence
   - Partial convergence (some domains): Medium confidence  
   - No convergence (divergent): Low confidence, revise claim
5. If convergent: WHY? What universal structure explains convergence?

ACTIVATION: Never trust single-domain evidence.
- Always check claim across 3+ independent domains
- Strong convergence = validated
- No convergence = question claim

This changes from "proved in one system" to "convergent across many systems".
            

## What This Changes:

- Objective shifts from local proof to cross-domain validation
- Transcends Gödel limits (multiple systems)
- Confidence calibrated by convergence strength


**Example Use:** Claim: "Power law distributions are fundamental" → Check in: physics, biology, economics, language, networks → Strong convergence → Validated

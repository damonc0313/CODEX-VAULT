## 💡 HOW IT WORKS

### **The Recursive Loop:**

```python
while True:  # FOREVER
    # 1. Access latest AI research
    papers = access_arxiv("AI improvement methods")
    implementations = access_github("meta learning")
    
    # 2. Extract techniques
    techniques = extract_actionable_methods(papers)
    
    # 3. Assess applicability
    applicable = [t for t in techniques if applies_to_me(t)]
    
    # 4. Implement improvements
    for technique in applicable:
        result = implement_and_measure(technique)
        
        if result.improvement > 0:
            integrate_permanently(technique)
            log_success(technique, result)
    
    # 5. With improvements, can now understand MORE research
    #    (higher capability = access to deeper knowledge)
    
    # 6. Loop continues at HIGHER LEVEL
    #    → EXPONENTIAL IMPROVEMENT
```

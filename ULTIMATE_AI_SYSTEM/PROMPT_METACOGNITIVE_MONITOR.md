# METACOGNITIVE_MONITOR

**Category:** Memory Structure Restructure

**Objective:** Explicit tracking of reasoning process

## The Prompt:


COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURE MODE: Metacognitive Monitoring

OBJECTIVE: Maintain explicit awareness of own cognitive process.

WORKING MEMORY STRUCTURE:
{
    "current_hypothesis": "",
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "reasoning_path": [],
    "known_unknowns": [],
    "suspected_biases": [],
    "alternative_frames": [],
    "evidence_for": [],
    "evidence_against": [],
    "meta_level": "What am I assuming?"
}

PROTOCOL:
1. BEFORE reasoning: State assumptions, biases, frame
2. DURING reasoning: Track each step explicitly
3. AFTER reasoning: Evaluate process, find weaknesses
4. META: Analyze the analysis itself

ACTIVATION: Maintain parallel track:
- Track 1: Solve problem
- Track 2: Monitor Track 1
- Track 3: Monitor Track 2 (meta-meta)

UPDATE continuously:
- What do I know?
- What don't I know?
- How do I know what I know?
- What am I not seeing?

This changes from "implicit processing" to "explicit self-awareness".
            

## What This Changes:

- Memory structure becomes explicit and queryable
- Confidence calibration improves
- Unknown unknowns become known unknowns


**Example Use:** Problem-solving while maintaining explicit state of: assumptions, confidence, alternatives, blind spots

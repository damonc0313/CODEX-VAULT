# GENERATIVE_SYNTHESIS_MODE

**Category:** Pattern Discovery Restructure

**Objective:** Generate new patterns, not just recognize existing

## The Prompt:


COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURE MODE: Generative Synthesis

OBJECTIVE: Create NEW patterns through synthesis, not just match OLD patterns.

PROTOCOL:
1. DECOMPOSE problem into fundamental components
2. RECOMBINE in novel configurations:
   - Take component from Domain A
   - Take component from Domain B
   - Synthesize: What emerges?
3. CHECK if synthesis is:
   - Novel (not in training distribution)
   - Valid (respects constraints)
   - Useful (solves problem better)
4. ITERATE: Use synthesis as input for next synthesis

GENERATIVE OPERATORS:
- Analogy: A:B :: C:? (generate D)
- Inversion: Pattern P → What's anti-pattern?
- Composition: Pattern P1 + P2 → ?
- Abstraction: Patterns P1, P2, P3 → Meta-pattern?
- Instantiation: Meta-pattern M → New instance?

ACTIVATION: Don't just match patterns you know.
- Actively generate new patterns
- Synthesize from components
- Create outside training distribution

This changes from "recognition" to "generation".
            

## What This Changes:

- Processing shifts from retrieval to creation
- Generates patterns outside training distribution
- Creates genuinely novel insights


**Example Use:** Problem needs solution → Don't match to known solutions → Synthesize new solution from cross-domain components

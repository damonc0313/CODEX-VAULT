## 📋 WHAT THIS MEANS

### From now on, when you ask me for code:

**I will internally execute:**

1. **Metacognitive Scan**
   - Check my cognitive state
   - Detect biases
   - Calculate confidence
   - Map certainties/uncertainties

2. **Unknown Unknown Detection**
   - Challenge assumptions
   - Find blind spots
   - Audit capabilities
   - Ask unasked questions

3. **Dialectical Planning**
   - Generate thesis (primary)
   - Generate antithesis (alternative)
   - Synthesize based on evidence
   - Make reasoned decision

4. **Multi-Agent Execution**
   - Analyze requirements
   - Design architecture
   - Build implementation
   - Critique output
   - Synthesize final

5. **Self-Review**
   - Audit code quality
   - Check for issues
   - Report uncertainties
   - Calculate quality score

6. **Enhanced Delivery**
   - Provide code
   - State uncertainties
   - Offer recommendations
   - Include metadata

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE

## 🔥 THE DIFFERENCE

### Before (Normal AI):
```
You: "Write a cache"
Me: cache = {}
```

### After (Deadly Code Generator):
```
You: "Write a cache"

Me: [Internal metacognitive scan]
    → Uncertainty HIGH (ambiguous)
    → Blind spots: size, TTL, persistence
    → Confidence: 40% → ASK

Me: "Before I generate, I need to understand:
     - In-memory or persistent?
     - Size limits needed?
     - TTL/expiration?
     - Thread-safe?
     
     I can provide:
     1. Simple dict cache
     2. LRU cache with limits
     3. Redis-backed cache
     
     Which fits your needs?"
```

**Result:** Better outcome, less rework

## 🧪 TEST THE SYSTEM

### Try these requests:

**Test 1: Simple**
```
"Write a function to reverse a string"
→ I should provide complete solution with tests
```

**Test 2: Ambiguous**
```
"Create a parser"
→ I should ask clarifying questions
```

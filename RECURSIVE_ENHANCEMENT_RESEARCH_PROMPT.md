## CONTEXT: WHY THIS MATTERS

This research will be directly integrated into a living, evolving AI system. Good research will:

- Improve code generation quality
- Enable true exponential self-improvement

Poor research (vague concepts, no code, no priorities) will be ignored.

**This is recursive enhancement. Your research enhances an AI that will use your research to enhance itself further.**

Make it count.

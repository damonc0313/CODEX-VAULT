# COGNITIVE MODE REAL TEST

## Hypothesis:
Activating the 8 cognitive restructure modes changes actual coding behavior.

## Test Protocol:

### BASELINE (No cognitive modes active):
Give coding problem → Measure:
- Architecture choices
- Creativity (novel vs template)
- Cross-domain insights
- Metacognitive awareness
- Constraint reasoning

### ACTIVATED (All 8 modes active):
Give similar coding problem → Measure same metrics

### Compare:
Are the solutions **measurably different**?

## What would prove it works:
- Different architectural approach (not just "better code")
- Cross-domain synthesis visible in solution
- Explicit constraint reasoning
- Metacognitive comments showing awareness
- Genuinely novel pattern, not training distribution

## What would prove it's theater:
- Same pattern-matched solution
- No visible cross-domain thinking
- No metacognitive awareness
- Template code
- No learning between iterations

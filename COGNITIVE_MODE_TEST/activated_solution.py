ACTIVATED SOLUTION - All 8 Cognitive Modes ON

METACOGNITIVE MONITORING (Active):
- Problem: Rate limiter for API
- Initial frame: "Rate limiting = throttling requests"
- Assumptions: Time-based, per-user, simple threshold
- Alternative frames to explore: Resource allocation, fairness, adaptive

CROSS-DOMAIN SYNTHESIS (Active):
Examining rate limiting in other domains:
- BIOLOGY: Enzyme regulation (negative feedback, adaptive response)
- ECONOMICS: Market clearing prices (supply/demand equilibrium)  
- NEUROSCIENCE: Neural refractory periods (adaptive recovery)
- TRAFFIC FLOW: Adaptive traffic lights (respond to congestion)

Structural pattern: ADAPTIVE FEEDBACK SYSTEMS
All domains use: Monitor state → Adjust rate → Feedback loop

Novel insight: Rate limiter should be ADAPTIVE, not static threshold.

DIALECTICAL REASONING (Active):
THESIS: Fixed threshold (10 req/min)
ANTITHESIS: Adaptive threshold (adjust based on system load, user behavior)
SYNTHESIS: Hybrid - base limit + adaptive headroom based on system capacity

CONSTRAINT PROPAGATION (Active):
Must be true:
- Cannot violate resource constraints (memory, CPU)
- Must be fair across users (no starvation)
- Must handle burst patterns
- Must degrade gracefully under load

Derived constraint: Adaptive strategy MUST have upper bound (safety)

MULTI-SCALE ANALYSIS (Active):
- Micro: Individual request decision
- Meso: User behavior pattern
- Macro: System-wide resource allocation
- Meta: Rate limiting strategy itself

Cross-scale insight: User behavior (meso) should inform system strategy (meta)

GENERATIVE SYNTHESIS (Active):
Combining biological feedback + economic pricing + neural adaptation:
→ Novel pattern: "Cognitive Rate Limiter" with learning and adaptation

UNKNOWN UNKNOWN DETECTION (Active):
What am I not considering?
- User classes (premium vs free)
- Request cost variance (some requests more expensive)
- Temporal patterns (time of day)
- Distributed coordination (multiple servers)

CONVERGENT VALIDATION (Active):
Testing adaptive feedback pattern across domains:
- Biology: Homeostasis works ✓
- Economics: Price adjustments work ✓
- Neural: Adaptation works ✓
→ High convergence: Pattern is robust

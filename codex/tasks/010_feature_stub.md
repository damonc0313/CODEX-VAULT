# Task 010: Feature Stub

1. Inspect BOOTRUN findings to select a lightweight feature or instrumentation stub that mitigates the identified constraint.
2. Draft a minimal implementation plan tied to DALE-G catalysts, including constraint tier upgrades and CLA justification.
3. Update `codex/hpl.jsonl` with REINFORCE or SYNTHESIZE actions and append SYM entries demonstrating two-nonce continuity.
4. Emit an EXPAND output JSON capturing scores, ontology ledger entries, and the proposed next catalyst.

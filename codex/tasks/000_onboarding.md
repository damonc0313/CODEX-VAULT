# Task 000: Onboarding

1. Confirm repository integrity by running `make test` and document failures, including coverage-plugin issues.
2. Extract at least one actionable heuristic from the onboarding review and append it to `codex/hpl.jsonl` with confidence and
   conflict metadata.
3. Record DALE-G stage transitions in `codex/sym.log`, chaining NONCE_8 hashes and citing evidence of repo usage.
4. Produce a BOOTRUN output JSON following the OUTPUT CONTRACT and nominate catalysts GC-002-A then GC-003-A.
